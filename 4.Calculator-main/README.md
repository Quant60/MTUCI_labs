# Calculator(4)

Task: Create a calculator(application) using the PyQt5 library. Progress:


1.Install the library for creating windowed applications (PyQt5).
We import the necessary libraries for creating the application (sys, QApplication, QWidget, QLineEdit, QHBoxLayout, QVBoxLayout, QPushButton).

2.Let's create a calculator class and inherit it from the QWidgets class.

3.Let's create events responsible for the reaction to pressing the buttons.

4.Let's create a class method for handling buttons responsible for entering numbers into the text input line.

5.Let's create a class method to handle pressing a button of a math operation.

6.Let's create a class method to handle clicking on the result button.

7.Let's create handling for all possible exceptions (division by zero).

8.Add buttons for mathematical operations: subtraction, multiplication, division.

9.Creation of methods for processing mathematical operations.

10.Conclusion: As I completed this task, I studied the libraries (PyQt5), and learned how to use them to write a calculator application.
